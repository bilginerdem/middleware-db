# Middleware Database Server (Middleware DB)

This project introduces a middleware layer between your application and the database server, facilitating secure data retrieval and transmission over the SQL server. For security reasons, many applications are not allowed to connect directly to the database server. This middleware can be utilized as a bridge between your application and the database server.

Adapting your existing applications to such a structure can be challenging, or your current architecture might not be compatible with this design. Middleware-db addresses this issue by offering adapters, allowing for quick and seamless integration without necessitating major modifications.
